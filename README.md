# hackathon

fork of this beautiful repo https://github.com/ChangoMan/nextjs-ethereum-starter tailored more towards what I do at hackathons
## Getting Started

we're using yarn

run

```bash
yarn
```

to install everything

# Building and running stuff

```bash
yarn compile
```

This will compile the contract and update the typechains and abi in frontend as well!

```bash
cd frontend
yarn
```

This will install the frontend packages

Then run 

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start up the Next.js development server. Your site will be available at http://localhost:3000/
